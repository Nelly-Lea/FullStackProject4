# My 4th fullstack project - React Application

## Introduction

Welcome to my fourth fullstack application project! This project showcases my expertise in React development with two distinct applications: a powerful rich text editor and an interactive multiplayer game called "Get to 100." Both applications are built using HTML, CSS, JSX, and React components, and they run locally on localhost:3000.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have designed and implemented two feature-rich applications:
- **Rich Text Editor:** A robust editor built to handle text formatting, styling, and media embedding. It provides users with a versatile platform for creating and editing content seamlessly.
- **Multiplayer Game - Get to 100:** An engaging game where multiple users can compete in real-time to reach the number 100. Players strategically add numbers, influencing the game state dynamically.

## Key Features

- **React Component Architecture:** Utilization of Reactâ€™s component-based structure to modularize functionalities, ensuring scalability and maintainability of both applications.
- **HTML, CSS, and JSX:** Integration of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JSX for efficient component rendering in React.
- **Local Development:** Applications are hosted and run locally on localhost:3000, allowing for easy testing and development.
- **User Interaction:** Interactive interfaces with intuitive user interactions in both the text editor and the multiplayer game, enhancing user engagement and experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** For building responsive and dynamic user interfaces across both applications.
- **HTML & CSS:** For structuring content and styling components within the applications.
- **JavaScript (JSX):** For rendering components and managing application logic.
- **Localhost Deployment:** Applications are served locally using localhost:3000, leveraging React's development server for efficient development and testing.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project include:
- **Mastering React Development:** Showcasing proficiency in React by implementing complex features and interactions in two distinct applications.
- **Enhancing User Experience:** Creating intuitive and responsive interfaces that optimize user interaction and satisfaction.
- **Scalable and Modular Architecture:** Designing a structured application with reusable components to facilitate future enhancements and scalability.

## Installation Guide
